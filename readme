Group members: Megan Kershaw, Matthew Guild, Guilherme Cassiano, Lucas Adams.

Project Goals: 
  *Monitor the water levels in a reservoir and print an alert when the water level is too low.
  *Monitor and display the current air temp and humidity on an LCD screen
  * Start and stop a motorized fan as needed when the temperature goes out of the specified range.
  * Allow user to adjust the angle of the vent from the system.
  * Allow user to enable or disable the system using an on/off button.
  * Record the date and time when the motor is turned off or on. 



 Summary of group work: 
As a group we decided to split up the work for this project. Cassiano and I focused more on the 
software part of it. I coded the beginning of the project and started to set it up. Megan and 
Lucas focused on the circuit and worked on the hardware aspect of the project. They tested my 
code and then edited it to make it work in the project and to connect with the other parts of 
the project. They also coded the angle of the vent, and the code for the motorized fan. Cassiano 
finished the project code and we both looked over the code as a whole and edited a few things so 
that the project would compile.
