Group members: Megan Kershaw, Matthew Guild, Guilherme Cassiano, Lucas Adams

Project Goals: 
  * Monitor the water levels in a reservoir and print an alert when the water level is too low.
  * Monitor and display the current air temp and humidity on an LCD screen.
  * Start and stop a motorized fan as needed when the temperature goes out of the specified range.
  * Allow user to adjust the angle of the vent from the system.
  * Allow user to enable or disable the system using an on/off button.
  * Record the date and time when the motor is turned off or on. 



Summary of group work: 
   As a group we decided to split up the work for this project. Cassiano and Matthew focused more
   on the software part of it, while Megan and Lucas focused on the physical part. Matthew coded 
   the beginning of the project and started to set it up. Megan and Lucas tested the code with 
   the circuit and edited the errors and re-did a lot of the code so that the circuit could work. 
   From the set up we were able to display the air temp and temp on the LCD, start and stop the
   fan, and adjust the angle of the vent. The biggest issues we had after the set up and getting 
   those parts to work was the on/off button, and the water level. Cassiano and Matthew went to 
   Bashira for help. We also found how to set it up with Arduino library functions and compared 
   that to the lab 9 code so that we could figure out how to take out the library functions and 
   still have it print. We showed this to Bashira and then also asked for advice for how to do 
   the on/off button. We then all got back together and finished the water level and the on off 
   button. Lucas then did the diagram of the circuit and Cassiano, Matthew and Megan worked on 
   the code a little bit more and completed the video.
